Overview

    Decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (DHIT) can be considered as the
    initial step in any turbulence model benchmark whilst, in particular, any
    cross-correlation in its statistics is ideally zero.

    Aim:

        Verification of the synthetic inflow turbulence boundary conditions in
        flows where no cross-correlation interactions exist:

        - turbulentDigitalFilterInlet fsm=true
        - turbulentDigitalFilterInlet fsm=false
        - turbulentDFSEMInlet

    Benchmark (Physical phenomenon):

        The DHIT benchmark is a stationary-grid approximately-isotropic decaying
        turbulent flow experiment from (Comte-Bellot and Corrsin, 1971).

    Benchmark scenario:

        Synthetic time-series were based upon the experimental measurements
        at 42M section, where M = 0.0508[m] is the mesh-grid and the
        characteristic size.

    Physical domain:

        Please refer to (A:p. 59) and (CC:p. 280).

    Physical modelling:

        - The governing equations for:
            - Time-variant, Newtonian, single-phase, incompressible fluid flows,
            excluding any thermal chemical, electromagnetic and scalar
            interactions
        - Mathematical approach for the turbulence modelling:
            - Implicitly-filtered large eddy simulation (IFLES;
            not implicit LES)
        - Turbulence closure model:
            - Smagorinsky model with van Driest wall-damping function
        - The sets of input (CC:p. 299):
            - Mean longitudinal flow speed, Uc = 12.7[m/s]
            - Fluid kinematic viscosity, nuLam = 1.4941e-5[m2/s]
            (based on Re_M = 3.4e4 [-], and Uo = 10[m/s])
            - One-point normal correlations, UPrime2Mean_ii = 4.9284e-2[m2/s2]
            - One-point anisotropic correlations, UPrime2Mean_ij = 0.0[m2/s2]

Overview

    Homogenous shear turbulence (HST) can be considered as a transition step
    wherein large-scale anisotropy is partially incorporated into decaying
    homogenous isotropic turbulence; nonetheless, the statistical uniformity
    in space and homogeneity in spanwise direction reduces the sophistication
    of the flow. By means of HST, isolated effects of a single one-spatial-point
    anisotropic stress and cross-integral length scale can be sought.

    Aim:

        Verification of the synthetic inflow turbulence boundary conditions in
        flows where isolated effects of a single one-spatial-point anisotropic
        stress and cross-integral length scale can be sought:

        - turbulentDigitalFilterInlet fsm=true
        - turbulentDigitalFilterInlet fsm=false
        - turbulentDFSEMInlet

    Benchmark (Physical phenomenon):

        The HST benchmark is an experiment of virtually transverse-homogenous
        uniform-shear turbulent flow from (Tavoularis and Corrsin, 1981).

    Benchmark scenario:

        Synthetic time-series were based upon the experimental measurements
        at x1/h=7.5 plane measurements, where h = 0.305[m] is the height of
        shear turbulence generator, and x1 the downstream distance to the
        generator.

    Physical domain:

        Please refer to (A:p. 87).

    Physical modelling:

        - The governing equations for:
            - Time-variant, Newtonian, single-phase, incompressible fluid flows,
            excluding any thermal chemical, electromagnetic and scalar
            interactions
        - Mathematical approach for the turbulence modelling:
            - Implicitly-filtered large eddy simulation (IFLES;
            not implicit LES)
        - Turbulence closure model:
            - Smagorinsky model with van Driest wall-damping function
        - The sets of input (TC:p. 320, 329, 334):
            - Mean longitudinal centreline flow speed, Uc = 12.4[m/s]
            - Fluid kinematic viscosity, nuLam = 1.49778636445e-5[m2/s]
            - One-point correlations:
                - UPrime2Mean_11 = 2.80e-1[m2/s2]
                - UPrime2Mean_22 = 1.00e-1[m2/s2]
                - UPrime2Mean_33 = 1.56e-1[m2/s2]
                - UPrime2Mean_12 = -4.50e-1[m2/s2]
                - Rest of UPrime2Mean_ij = 0.0[m2/s2]
            - Integral length scales (For Lij,k - ij signifies the directions
              of two velocity components in hand, and k measurement direction):
                - L11,1 = 4.4e-2[m]
                - L22,1 = 1.012e-2[m]
                - L33,1 = 1.496e-2[m]
                - L11,2 = 1.452e-2[m]
                - L11,3 = 1.1e-2[m]
                - L22,2 = L22,3 = 5.06e-3[m]
                - L33,2 = L33,3 = 7.48e-3[m]
                - The last four scales were derived by the isotropy assumption,
                e.g. 0.5*L22,1 = L22,2.
